I am currently Bulb’s Marketing Writer. My main role is writing copy to promote the brand and convert users to switch their energy provider. During my time here I’ve worked on website copy, emails, digital ads, outdoor advertising, leaflets, blog posts, help pages and much, much more. In addition to this, I also manage the sponsorship of Dulwich Hamlet FC, formerly branded ‘the most hipster club in football’.

Here’s a little insight into some of the key aspects of my work:

<strong>Emails</strong>
From one-off sends to A/B testing campaigns. Email open rate often averaged out at 62%, and click rate at 8%. I put this down to the structure and tone of voice within the emails that made the content easily digestible, which allowed the user to understand what they had to do.

<strong>Web pages</strong>
I tweaked and built new web pages working collaboratively with a range of stakeholders including graphic designers, product designers and engineers. By using a straightforward tone of voice I was able to get information across quickly, which allowed us to present call to actions in strategic positions on the page resulting in a higher rate of conversion.

<strong>Dulwich Hamlet FC </strong>
While managing this sponsorship I created countless assets to promote a referral link that would give the club, and each reader who signed up, £50. Refreshing content every 10 days provided a range of challenges which pushed me to generate relevant and original content in tight deadlines. 

<strong>Training</strong>
Most Mondays were spent teaching Bulb’s tone of voice to a class of 20-30 new hires. I’d often welcome feedback and adapt the training based on these comments. My sessions proved a great success with an average NPS of 4.85/5.
