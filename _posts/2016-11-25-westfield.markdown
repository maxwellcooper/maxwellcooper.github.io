To raise awareness of their new ‘product search’ feature, I ran a series of promotional ads for Westfield. I utilised a string of different messaging which allowed me to pull insights from these experiments to inform homepage copy. 

Variants of A/B tests were compiled with different messaging, all focusing on the usage of the search feature.
